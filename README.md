# Linear-regression_predicting-insurance-charges

We build a linear regression model to predict healthcare insurance charges based on categorical variables (e.g. smoker) and numerical variables (e.g. age). We start by preprocessing the data before fitting the model and evaluating its accuracy, aiming for a R-Squared Score above 0.65. When then apply the model to unseen data to predict insurance charges, with a floor at $1000.
